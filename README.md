# 🛳 Titanic Survival Prediction Exploratory Data Analysis Project
A data analysis and visualization project on the Titanic dataset, exploring passenger survival patterns. This project focuses on summarizing, 
and visualizing data with histograms, boxplots, violin plots, and correlation analysis to uncover trends and insights in survival across age, gender, and class.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python 3.x**  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis  
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib** – Plotting and visualization  
- **Seaborn** – Advanced visualizations

The Project Covers:
## 🔍 Features & Analysis

1. **Dataset Overview & Cleaning**  
   - Inspect dataset shape, columns, and data types  
   - Identify missing values  

2. **Summary Statistics**  
   - Numerical features: mean, median, std, min, max  
   - Categorical features: unique counts, top frequent values  

3. **Visualization**  
   - **Histograms**: Distribution of numerical features  
   - **Boxplots**: Detect outliers  
   - **Correlation Heatmap**: Relationships between numerical features  
   - **Pairplots**: Feature relationships with survival  
   - **Bar plots**: Survival by Age Group, Sex, and Class  
   - **Violin plots**: Age distribution by Class and Survival  

4. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Created `AgeGroup` to categorize passengers: Child, Teen, Adult, Middle, Senior

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Gender:** Females had higher survival rates than males.  
- **Class:** First-class passengers survived more often than lower classes.  
- **Age:** Children and younger adults had better survival chances.  
- **Fare:** Right-skewed distribution; some paid very high fares.  
- **Socio-economic impact:** Third-class and older passengers had lowest survival.  
- **Evacuation trends:** Violin plots show children and higher-class passengers were prioritized.
